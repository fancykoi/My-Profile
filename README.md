- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Caifeng Li (github: @fancykoi).

- üíûÔ∏è At present, I am a junior graduate student pursuing a master‚Äôs degree and majoring in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the Computational Biology Center, Beijing Forestry University (Beijing, China).

- üå± Prof. Rongling Wu (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rongling-Wu) is my academic supervisor and my research mainly focuses on exploring the relationship between genes and dynamic phenotypic data using statistical models and computer programming languages.

- üëÄ I wish to pursue a doctoral degree in the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Program (Machine learning and Deep learning are more preferred) in 2023 Fall.

My ORCID homepage can be found here: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9157-367X. During my postgraduate period, my academic performance has been excellent, with a GPA of 90.6 (90.6/100), ranking first in the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics major. I won the first prize scholarship for two consecutive years (2020&2021) with the honor of ‚ÄúOutstanding Graduate Student‚Äù (2021) and the 3rd prize in the 13th China Mathematical Contest in Modeling for Postgraduate Students in 2021. Up until now, I have published two SCI papers as the first author (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13060976, https://github.com/fancykoi/fancykoi/files/9713044/genes-13-00976.pdf) and the third author (https://doi.org/10.48130/FR-2021-0019, https://github.com/fancykoi/fancykoi/files/9713045/FR-2021-0019.pdf).

My skills can be summarized as follows:
- R language and data cleaning, data mining, statistical model.
- Python language and NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow framework.
- SQL language and MySQL operation & Linux general operation.
- Bioinformatics analysis software and methods, as well as RNA-Seq differential gene analysis methods.

During my doctoral studies, I hope to explore scientific problems that require profound theoretical support and mathematical deduction from a broader perspective and tend to apply cutting-edge technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, to solve practical problems related to biomedical big data. I am a self-study, self-motivated, diligent, and optimistic person who loves scientific research. When facing difficult problems, I have never been overwhelmed, seeking solutions has been always my first choice.

Postgraduate thesis project (08/2021-Present)
- Team Leader, Prof. Rongling Wu (supervisor, world-renowned computational biology expert, "Changjiang Scholar", "National Distinguished Professor" of Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee)
- Studied the key genes and the mechanism of competition and cooperation in the interaction between the two bacteria by System Mapping model based on the phenotypic data and SNPs data produced by 100 pairs of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus under co-culture conditions, and about to submit a paper in November.
- Selected the ordinary differential equations of Lotka-Volterran interspecific competition model to construct the mean vector and used the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm to solve the ordinary differential equations. Utilized SAD (2) to construct the covariance matrix, and the MLE framework of the multivariate normal distribution mixed model was used for parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. The parameters were optimized based on the least square method and the gradient descent method.

Genome-Wide Identification and Analysis of the NAC Transcription Factor Gene Family in Garden Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis). (01/2022-06/2022)
- Team Leader, Dr. Xuli Zhu (supervisor)
- Identified a total of 85 Asparagus officinalis NAC genes and systematically analyzed the gene family through bioinformatics methods, including physicochemical properties, phylogenetic relationship, chromosome localization, gene structure, conserved motifs, intron/exon, cis-acting elements, gene duplication, syntenic analysis, and differential gene expression analysis.
- A paper was published based on this research (first author, https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13060976).
