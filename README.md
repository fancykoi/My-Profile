- 👋 Hi, I’m Caifeng Li (github: @fancykoi).

- 💞️ At present, I am a junior graduate student pursuing a master’s degree and majoring in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the Computational Biology Center, Beijing Forestry University (Beijing, China).

- 🌱 Prof. Rongling Wu (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rongling-Wu) is my academic supervisor and my research mainly focuses on exploring the relationship between genes and dynamic phenotypic data using statistical models and computer programming languages.

- 👀 I wish to pursue a doctoral degree in the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Program (Machine learning and Deep learning are more preferred) in 2023 Fall.

My ORCID homepage can be found here: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9157-367X. During my postgraduate period, my academic performance has been excellent, with a GPA of 90.6 (90.6/100), ranking first in the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics major. I won the first prize scholarship for two consecutive years (2020&2021) with the honor of “Outstanding Graduate Student” (2021) and the 3rd prize in the 13th China Mathematical Contest in Modeling for Postgraduate Students in 2021. Up until now, I have published two SCI papers as the first author (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13060976) and the third author (https://doi.org/10.48130/FR-2021-0019), please see the attachment CV for details.
