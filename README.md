- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Caifeng Li (github: @fancykoi).

- üíûÔ∏è At present, I am a junior graduate student pursuing a master‚Äôs degree and majoring in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the Computational Biology Center, Beijing Forestry University (Beijing, China).

- üå± Prof. Rongling Wu (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rongling-Wu) is my academic supervisor and my research mainly focuses on exploring the relationship between genes and dynamic phenotypic data using statistical models and computer programming languages.

- üëÄ I wish to pursue a doctoral degree in the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Program (Machine learning and Deep learning are more preferred) in 2023 Fall.

My ORCID homepage can be found here: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9157-367X. During my postgraduate period, my academic performance has been excellent, with a GPA of 90.6 (90.6/100), ranking first in the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics major. I won the first prize scholarship for two consecutive years (2020&2021) with the honor of ‚ÄúOutstanding Graduate Student‚Äù (2021) and the 3rd prize in the 13th China Mathematical Contest in Modeling for Postgraduate Students in 2021. Up until now, I have published two SCI papers as the first author (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13060976, https://github.com/fancykoi/fancykoi/files/9713044/genes-13-00976.pdf) and the third author (https://doi.org/10.48130/FR-2021-0019, https://github.com/fancykoi/fancykoi/files/9713045/FR-2021-0019.pdf).

My skills can be summarized as follows:
- R language and data cleaning, data mining, statistical model.
- Python language and NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow framework.
- SQL language and MySQL operation & Linux general operation.
- Bioinformatics analysis software and methods, as well as RNA-Seq differential gene analysis methods.

During my doctoral studies, I hope to explore scientific problems that require profound theoretical support and mathematical deduction from a broader perspective and tend to apply cutting-edge technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, to solve practical problems related to biomedical big data. I am a self-study, self-motivated, diligent, and optimistic person who loves scientific research. When facing difficult problems, I have never been overwhelmed, seeking solutions has been always my first choice.
